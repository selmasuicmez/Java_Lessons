		 1) Child can use parents' methods, variables, 
		 objects, I mean class members  but if they are
		 private child cannot use them. If the class 
		 members are default you can use them just from
		 same package but is very problematic because of that 
		 we tell in inheritance we use public and protected
		 class members.
		 2) The other name of child class is subclass, the other name
		 of parent class is super class.
		 3) In inheritance every time we will work with instance variables 
		 and methods. We do not use static class members
		 4)A parent class can have many child classes but a child class 
		 can have just one parent class.
		 5)What is the benefit of inheritance?
